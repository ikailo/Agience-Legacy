# Agience

Agience is a platform and ecosystem designed to make intelligent agents accessible and rewarding for everyone.

This repository contains the open-source code for the Agience platform. Note that it requires a connection to an Authority to function. We are currently working on a preview instance with detailed documentation and tutorials.

## Plugins

Plugins contain functions used by agents to transform and connect information. These plugins extend the capabilities of agents, allowing them to interact with various data sources and services.

## Hosts

Hosts provide the infrastructure for running intelligent agents. They ensure that agents have the necessary resources and environment to operate efficiently.

## SDK

The SDK is the core of the platform and provides all the necessary code to create functions and plugins for intelligent agents on the Agience platform.

## Upcoming

We are actively working on a public release that will include comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help you get started with Agience.  Stay tuned for updates!
