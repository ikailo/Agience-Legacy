# Agience
## Intelligent Agents for Everyone

Agience is an **open-source** intelligent **agent framework** and **platform** that intuitively and seamlessly **connects devices**, **systems**, and **data** to achieve new levels of **automation** and **efficiency**.

This open-source project enables anyone to create and deploy intelligent agents that can automate tasks, process complex information, and facilitate communication between devices and systems at scale.

## Key Features

- **Modular and Scalable**: Agience is built to scale, making it adaptable for personal projects or large-scale industrial applications.
- **Open-Source**: Released under the MPL-2.0 license, offering flexibility and customization to businesses and developers.
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Deploy autonomous agents equipped with specialized functions for handling data, automating processes, and communicating across networks.
- **Real-Time Decision-Making**: Agents process real-time data to make intelligent decisions, reducing operational delays and improving overall efficiency.
- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with a wide range of systems and protocols, making it easy to integrate with existing technologies.

## Framework Architecture

### Host
The Host application is deployed onto devices or computer systems, enabling agent interaction with local services and resources.

### Agents and Agencies
Agents are autonomous units that perform specific tasks, gather data, and communicate with other agents. Groups of connected agents form an agency, which allows for task coordination and shared access to common data sources or services.

### Functions and Plugins
Functions are predefined tasks or behaviors that an agent can perform, such as controlling external systems, analyzing data, or managing communications. Plugins bundle related functions, extending agent capabilities.

### Authority
The authority defines and manages governance, resource allocation, identity, and metadata for its hosts and agents.

### Protocol
The protocol standardizes communication between agents, hosts, and the authority, ensuring consistency, resource management, and time synchronization across the network.
