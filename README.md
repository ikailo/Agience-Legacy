# Agience Framework

Agience is an **open-source** intelligent **agent framework** and **platform** that intuitively and seamlessly **connects devices**, **systems**, and **data** to achieve new levels of **automation** and **efficiency**.

This open-source project enables developers to create and deploy intelligent agents that can automate tasks, process complex information, and facilitate communication between systems at scale.

## Key Features

- **Modular and Scalable**: Agience is built to scale, supporting everything from small IoT networks to large-scale industrial deployments.
- **Open-Source**: Released under the MPL-2.0 license, offering flexibility and customization to businesses and developers.
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Deploy autonomous agents equipped with specialized functions for handling data, automating processes, and communicating across networks.
- **Real-Time Decision-Making**: Agents process real-time data to make intelligent decisions, reducing operational delays and improving overall efficiency.
- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with a wide range of systems and protocols, making it easy to integrate with existing technologies.

## Architecture Overview

Agience consists of several core components that together form a cohesive, highly interoperable network of intelligent agents:

### Host
The Host application is deployed onto devices or computer systems to enable agent interaction with local services and resources.

### Agents and Agencies
Agents are autonomous units that perform specific tasks, gather data, and communicate with other agents. Groups of connected agents form an **Agency**, which allows for task coordination and shared access to common data sources or services.

### Functions and Plugins
Functions are predefined tasks or behaviors that an agent can perform, such as controlling external systems, analyzing data, or managing communications. Plugins bundle related functions, extending agent capabilities.

### Authority and Identity Management
The **Authority** component manages user identities, authentication, and configurations across the network. It ensures secure governance and resource management for large-scale deployments.

### Agience Protocol
The Agience Protocol standardizes communication between agents, hosts, and the authority, ensuring consistency, resource management, and time synchronization across the network.
